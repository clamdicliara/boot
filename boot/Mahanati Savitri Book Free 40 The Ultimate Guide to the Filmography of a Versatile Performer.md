Some of Savitri's films are considered as classics and landmarks of Indian cinema. Here are five films of the late actress that are a must watch for any film lover:
 
1. **Mayabazar (1957)**: This film is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made in India. It is based on a sub-plot of the epic Mahabharata, and features Savitri as Sasirekha, the daughter of Balarama and the love interest of Abhimanyu. Savitri's performance as the innocent and charming princess is delightful and memorable. The film also stars N.T. Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao and S.V. Ranga Rao in pivotal roles.
2. **Missamma (1955)**: This film is a comedy-drama that revolves around two unemployed graduates who pretend to be a married couple to get a job as teachers in a school run by a strict Christian. Savitri plays Mary, a Christian woman who falls in love with M.T. Rao (N.T. Rama Rao), a Hindu man who poses as her husband. Savitri's comic timing and chemistry with N.T. Rama Rao are the highlights of the film.
3. **Devadasu (1953)**: This film is based on the novel Devdas by Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, and tells the tragic story of Devadasu (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), a wealthy man who becomes an alcoholic after being separated from his childhood love Parvathi (Savitri). Savitri's portrayal of Parvathi, who suffers silently for her love, is heart-wrenching and soulful. The film was a huge success and received special mentions at India International Film Festival.
4. **Gundamma Katha (1962)**: This film is a comedy-drama that deals with the theme of gender equality and social justice. It features Savitri as Lakshmi, a kind-hearted and educated woman who marries Anji (N.T. Rama Rao), the son of Gundamma (Suryakantham), a rich and arrogant widow who ill-treats her daughter-in-law Saroja (Jamuna). Savitri's role as Lakshmi, who teaches Gundamma a lesson with her intelligence and dignity, is inspiring and empowering.
5. **Aradhana (1962)**: This film is a musical romance that showcases Savitri's singing talent. She plays Radha, a singer who falls in love with Gopi (Akkineni Nageswara Rao), a harmonium player. The film has some of the most melodious songs composed by Saluri Rajeswara Rao and sung by Ghantasala and P. Susheela. Savitri's voice modulation and expression as Radha are mesmerizing and enchanting.
